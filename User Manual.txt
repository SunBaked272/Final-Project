What is this program?:
This game recommendation tool is for new and veteran gamers alike. If you’re in the situation where you want to play a game but don’t know which one, I can help you out with that. 
This program will ask you a series of three questions and recommend a game to play based on your responses. Happy gaming!

How to use this program:
Simply download the StichterAaronFinalProject.py file and run it. 
The home page shows a header of the program title and a brief intro message to get you started. 
To begin, press “Start”. To quit, press “Exit” or, at any time, press the “X” in the corner of the window. 

After selecting “Start”, you will be taken to the page for Question 1. Answer accordingly by pressing the corresponding button.
After selecting an answer, you will be taken to the page for Question 2. Repeat for questions 2 and 3. 

After answering all questions, you will be taken to the “Recommendation” page, where a game title and info will be displayed. For your convenience, the game’s price, difficulty, platform, and Metacritic rating will all be displayed. 
Choose either “Restart” to go through the program again, or press “Exit” to quit.
