SDEV 140 - Game Selector Tool - Final Project

This is a Game Selector Tool for people who are struggling to decide on a video game to play. It's useful for new and experienced gamers alike. It will ask you a few questions then output a recommended game, along with some info about it.

**What I have done**:
I have completed the program and now have a fully working GUI. I have a Home screen that gives a brief description of the program, and an option to either continue or exit. Upon clicking "Start", users will see a series of three questions with three possible responses each. After all three have been answered, a recommended game will show, along with some info including price, platform, difficulty, and Metacritic rating. Users have the option to either restart or exit. 


**What needs done**:
I don't have any images in my program yet. I need to upload testing documentation. Finally I need to create a user manual.

**What I have done**:
So far I have a completely working program that runs in the terminal. It uses modular programming practices for easy maintainability. I originally wanted to give two game recommendations but I had to scale back after realizing how big the program would become. So now I have one recommendation for every possible combination of answers given by the user.


**What needs done**:
I still have to rework this into a GUI program. But the core of the program is there and working. I'll have to add all windows, labels, buttons, and images.
